                <p>World Science Day for Peace and Development, celebrated annually on November 10, shines a light on
                    the role science plays in advancing society and fostering peace worldwide. Launched by UNESCO in
                    2001, this day underscores the importance of making scientific knowledge accessible to all and
                    ensuring that people can make informed decisions about issues affecting their lives. Through various
                    events and educational programs, World Science Day raises awareness about how science can be
                    harnessed to tackle pressing global challenges, including climate change, health crises, and food
                    security. It also serves as a reminder that scientific progress is essential to sustainable
                    development and improving human well-being</p>

                <p>Beyond highlighting the importance of science, World Science Day promotes collaboration and
                    inclusivity within the scientific community. By encouraging partnerships between scientists,
                    governments, and communities, it fosters a cooperative approach to addressing the world’s most
                    significant challenges. This day also underscores the need for ethical and socially responsible
                    science practices, which consider the environmental and social impacts of scientific endeavors.
                    Ultimately, World Science Day aims to inspire young people to pursue careers in science and to
                    ensure that science remains a force for positive change in the world, promoting a peaceful and
                    sustainable future for all.</p>

            <h1 class="section-heading" id="two">SCIENTISTS</h1>
            <p>Scientists are the curious minds driving discoveries that shape our understanding of the world and propel
                innovation across every field. Through rigorous study, experimentation, and analysis, they investigate
                complex questions about everything from the inner workings of cells to the vastness of the cosmos.
                Working in laboratories, research facilities, or in the field, scientists rely on critical thinking,
                patience, and creativity to push the boundaries of what’s known. Their contributions lead to
                advancements in medicine, technology, environmental protection, and countless other areas that improve
                human life and help solve global challenges. By communicating their findings and collaborating
                internationally, scientists not only deepen our knowledge but also inspire future generations to pursue
                science, ensuring the continued pursuit of truth, progress, and sustainability.</p>

                        system on 26 January 1926. He went on to invent the first publicly demonstrated colour
                        television system and the first viable purely electronic colour television picture tube.</p>

                        substance, which he named penicillin. His discovery in 1928 of what was later named
                        benzylpenicillin (or penicillin G) from the mould Penicillium rubens has been described as the
                        "single greatest victory ever achieved over disease". For this discovery, he shared the Nobel
                        Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 with Howard Florey and Ernst Chain.</p>

                    <p>James Clerk Maxwell FRS FRSE (13 June 1831 – 5 November 1879) was a Scottish physicist and
                        mathematician[1][2] who was responsible for the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation,
                        which was the first theory to describe electricity, magnetism and light as different
                        manifestations of the same phenomenon. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called
                        the "second great unification in physics" where the first one had been realised by Isaac Newton.
